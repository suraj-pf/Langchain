    "**LangChain Core Components: A Structural Overview**\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Models: The Foundation**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Purpose:** LangChain provides a standardized interface to interact with various AI models, preventing vendor lock-in.\n",
    "    \n",
    "- **Core Types:**\n",
    "    \n",
    "    - **LLMs (Large Language Models):**\n",
    "        \n",
    "        - **Input/Output:** Text -> Text.\n",
    "            \n",
    "        - **Use Case:** Simple text generation and completion tasks.\n",
    "            \n",
    "        - _Examples:_ `OpenAI` (GPT-3.5-turbo), `Anthropic` (Claude).\n",
    "            \n",
    "    - **Chat Models:**\n",
    "        \n",
    "        - **Input/Output:** List of structured messages -> AI Message.\n",
    "            \n",
    "        - **Use Case:** Multi-turn conversations where context and roles (System, Human, AI) matter.\n",
    "            \n",
    "    - **Embedding Models:**\n",
    "        \n",
    "        - **Input/Output:** Text -> Vector (a list of numbers).\n",
    "            \n",
    "        - **Use Case:** Powering semantic search, clustering, and retrieval by converting text into numerical representations.\n",
    "            \n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Prompts: Engineering the Instructions**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Purpose:** To create dynamic, reusable, and effective instructions for the LLMs.\n",
    "    \n",
    "- **Key Techniques:**\n",
    "    \n",
    "    - **Prompt Templates:** Create prompts with placeholders (`{variable}`) to inject dynamic context, making prompts reusable.\n",
    "        \n",
    "    - **Role-Based Prompting:** Using `SystemMessage` to set the AI's behavior, personality, and rules at the start of a conversation.\n",
    "        \n",
    "    - **Few-Shot Prompting:** Including examples within the prompt to teach the model the desired format or style of response.\n",
    "        \n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Chains: Orchestrating Workflows**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Purpose:** To combine multiple components (models, prompts, logic) into a single, executable pipeline.\n",
    "    \n",
    "- **Core Concept:** The output of one step becomes the input to the next, automating multi-step processes.\n",
    "    \n",
    "- **Chain Types:**\n",
    "    \n",
    "    - **Sequential Chains:** A linear flow (e.g., `Input -> LLM (Translate) -> LLM (Summarize) -> Output`).\n",
    "        \n",
    "    - **Parallel Chains:** Running multiple chains simultaneously on the same input and then combining the results (e.g., generating different sections of a report in parallel).\n",
    "        \n",
    "    - **Conditional Chains:** Incorporating `if/else` logic to create dynamic workflows based on the output of a previous step (e.g., routing user feedback to different endpoints).\n",
    "        \n",
    "\n",
    "**4. Indexes: Connecting to External Knowledge**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Purpose:** To give your LLM application access to private or specialized data it wasn't trained on (e.g., company PDFs, websites, databases). This is the foundation of **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**.\n",
    "    \n",
    "- **The RAG Pipeline:**\n",
    "    \n",
    "    1. **Document Loader:** Loads data from a source (PDF, website, DB).\n",
    "        \n",
    "    2. **Text Splitter:** Breaks documents into smaller, semantically meaningful chunks.\n",
    "        \n",
    "    3. **Vector Store:** Creates embeddings for each chunk and stores them in a database.\n",
    "        \n",
    "    4. **Retriever:** Given a user query, it finds the most semantically relevant document chunks from the vector store and passes them to the LLM as context.\n",
    "        \n",
    "\n",
    "**5. Memory: Maintaining State**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Purpose:** To persist state/information between interactions with the LLM, as LLM API calls are inherently stateless.\n",
    "    \n",
    "- **Common Memory Types:**\n",
    "    \n",
    "    - **Conversation Buffer Memory:** Stores the raw text of the entire conversation.\n",
    "        \n",
    "    - **Conversation Buffer Window Memory:** Stores only the last `K` interactions to manage context length.\n",
    "        \n",
    "    - **Conversation Summary Memory:** Compresses the past conversation into a summary to save tokens.\n",
    "        \n",
    "    - **Custom Memory:** For storing specialized, structured data (e.g., user preferences, entity facts).\n",
    "        \n",
    "\n",
    "**6. Agents: AI with Reasoning and Tools**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Purpose:** To create \"goal-oriented\" AI that can reason and use tools to take actions.\n",
    "    \n",
    "- **Core Analogy:** An agent is a chatbot with superpowers.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    - **Chatbot:** Answers questions based on its internal knowledge.\n",
    "        \n",
    "    - **AI Agent:** _Reasons_ about a goal, _plans_ steps, and _uses tools_ (like a calculator, web search, or booking API) to achieve it.\n",
    "        \n",
    "- **Key Components:** An LLM for reasoning, a set of `Tools` it can use, and an agent executor that manages the decision-loop.\n",

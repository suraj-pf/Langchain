    "# LangChain Core Components: A Structural Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. **Models: The Foundation**\n",
    "- **Purpose**: LangChain provides a unified interface to interact with various AI models, preventing vendor lock-in.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Core Types**:\n",
    "  - **LLMs (Large Language Models)**:\n",
    "    - **Input/Output**: Text → Text\n",
    "    - **Use Case**: Text generation and completion.\n",
    "    - **Examples**: OpenAI (GPT-3.5-turbo), Anthropic (Claude).\n",
    "  \n",
    "  - **Chat Models**:\n",
    "    - **Input/Output**: Structured messages → AI message.\n",
    "    - **Use Case**: Multi-turn conversations with context and roles (System, Human, AI).\n",
    "  \n",
    "  - **Embedding Models**:\n",
    "    - **Input/Output**: Text → Vector (list of numbers).\n",
    "    - **Use Case**: Semantic search, clustering, and retrieval by converting text into numerical vectors.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. **Prompts: Engineering the Instructions**\n",
    "- **Purpose**: To create dynamic, reusable instructions for LLMs.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Key Techniques**:\n",
    "  - **Prompt Templates**: Create prompts with placeholders (`{variable}`) for dynamic context.\n",
    "  - **Role-Based Prompting**: Use a `SystemMessage` to set AI behavior at the start of a conversation.\n",
    "  - **Few-Shot Prompting**: Provide examples within prompts to guide the model's response style.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. **Chains: Orchestrating Workflows**\n",
    "- **Purpose**: Combine multiple components (models, prompts, logic) into an executable pipeline.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Core Concept**: The output of one step becomes the input to the next, automating multi-step processes.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Chain Types**:\n",
    "  - **Sequential Chains**: A linear series of steps (e.g., `Input → LLM (Translate) → LLM (Summarize) → Output`).\n",
    "  - **Parallel Chains**: Multiple chains run at the same time and combine results (e.g., generating different sections of a report in parallel).\n",
    "  - **Conditional Chains**: Use `if/else` logic to dynamically alter workflows based on previous results.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4. **Indexes: Connecting to External Knowledge**\n",
    "- **Purpose**: To give LLMs access to external data (e.g., PDFs, websites, databases) for enhanced responses.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **RAG Pipeline**:\n",
    "  1. **Document Loader**: Loads data from external sources (e.g., PDFs, websites).\n",
    "  2. **Text Splitter**: Breaks documents into smaller, meaningful chunks.\n",
    "  3. **Vector Store**: Creates and stores embeddings of document chunks.\n",
    "  4. **Retriever**: Finds the most relevant document chunks based on a query and passes them to the LLM as context.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 5. **Memory: Maintaining State**\n",
    "- **Purpose**: To retain information between interactions with an LLM, as LLM calls are stateless by default.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Common Memory Types**:\n",
    "  - **Conversation Buffer Memory**: Stores the raw text of the entire conversation.\n",
    "  - **Conversation Buffer Window Memory**: Stores only the last `K` interactions, helping manage context length.\n",
    "  - **Conversation Summary Memory**: Compresses past conversations into summaries to save tokens.\n",
    "  - **Custom Memory**: Stores user-specific data (e.g., preferences, facts).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 6. **Agents: AI with Reasoning and Tools**\n",
    "- **Purpose**: To create goal-oriented AI that can reason and use external tools to take actions.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Core Analogy**: An agent is like a chatbot with superpowers.\n",
    "  - **Chatbot**: Answers questions based on its internal knowledge.\n",
    "  - **AI Agent**: Reasons about goals, plans steps, and uses tools (e.g., calculators, web search) to achieve them.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Key Components**:\n",
    "  - **LLM** for reasoning.\n",
    "  - **Tools** that the agent can use (e.g., calculator, web search).\n",
    "  - **Agent Executor**: Manages the decision-making loop of the agent."
